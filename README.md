# Rocket Landing Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to predict whether  SpaceX  rocket launches will  land successfully or not. This aim of this project is to give actionable insights that enable SpaceX to predict their revenue and cost for the rockets.
## Business Problem
SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of 62 million dollars, significantly lower than other providers who charge upwards of 165 million dollars per launch. The substantial cost savings are primarily due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. Accurately predicting the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully allows for precise determination of the launch cost. Your task, as a data scientist hired by a competing startup, is to leverage data science findings and models to enable the company to make more competitive bids against SpaceX for rocket launches.
## Objective
1. **Predictive Modeling**: Utilize data science and machine learning techniques to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, which will help in estimating the cost of a launch.
2. **Data Exploration**: Analyze and explore the available data to gain deeper insights and inform the predictive models.
